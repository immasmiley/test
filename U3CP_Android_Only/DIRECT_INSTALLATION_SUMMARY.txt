# Direct Python Installation Summary

## Installation Status:
- F-Droid: INSTALLED AND RUNNING
- Python Installation: ATTEMPTED VIA F-DROID
- Python Packages: READY TO INSTALL

## What Was Done:
1. F-Droid was launched successfully
2. Pydroid 3 installation was initiated via F-Droid
3. Python test script was created and pushed to device

## Next Steps:
1. Check your device - F-Droid should be open
2. Look for Pydroid 3 installation progress
3. If installation completes, open Pydroid 3
4. Install Python packages: flask, requests, psutil, pillow
5. Run: python /sdcard/python_test.py

## Alternative: Pure HTML System
If Python installation fails, use the pure HTML system:
- Open browser on device
- Go to: file:///sdcard/pure_u3cp.html
- This works without Python!

## Files Available on Device:
- /sdcard/F-Droid.apk (11.9MB)
- /sdcard/pure_u3cp.html (Pure HTML U3CP System)
- /sdcard/real_system_dashboard.py (Python Dashboard)
- /sdcard/python_test.py (Python Test Script)

## Troubleshooting:
- If F-Droid doesn't show Pydroid 3, search manually
- If installation fails, try QPython 3 instead
- If nothing works, use the pure HTML system
